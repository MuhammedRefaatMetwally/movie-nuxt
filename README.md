# Movie App Task
My Approach in Backend for Movie Data:
<br>
1- I wanted to use TMD Apis but I have to request the apikey so it would take time, so I did not go with it.
<br>
2- JSON server: By asking the  AI if I could deploy it with my fronend and with the answer of #NO, and you have to upload that JSON server seperaterly which I could not, I think its because of the credit card.
<br>
3- So when asked the AI about seraching about a free Movie API to use. It did suggest to me the https://mockapi.io/, and I did use it as the backend for the movies API, and the (GET ALL DATA, POST, DELETE) methods worked with, but UPDATE did not for some reason.
<br>
# So that was my approach for my Backend hopefully it doesn't violate the rules, and I told you that to be honest as much as I could.<br>
And of course, the Frontend I did it myself. Thanks to Allah.
